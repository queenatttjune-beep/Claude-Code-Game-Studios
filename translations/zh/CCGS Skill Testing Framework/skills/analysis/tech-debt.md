# Skill 测试 Spec: /tech-debt

## Skill 摘要

`/tech-debt` tracks, categorizes, and prioritizes technical debt across the
codebase. It reads `docs/tech-debt-register.md` for the existing debt register
and scans source files in `src/` for inline `TODO` and `FIXME` comments. It
merges and sorts items by severity. No director gates are invoked. The skill
asks "May I write to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?" before updating. 裁决：
REGISTER UPDATED or NO NEW DEBT FOUND.

## 静态断言（结构性）

Verified automatically by `/skill-test static` — no fixture needed.

- [ ] Has required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`
- [ ] Has ≥2 phase headings
- [ ] Contains verdict keywords: REGISTER UPDATED, NO NEW DEBT FOUND
- [ ] Contains "May I write" language (skill writes to debt register)
- [ ] Has a next-step handoff (what to do after register is updated)

---

## Director Gate 检查

无。 Tech debt tracking is an internal codebase analysis skill; no gates are
invoked.

## 测试用例

### 用例 1: Happy Path — Inline TODOs plus existing register items merged

**设置：**
- `docs/tech-debt-register.md` exists with 2 items (LOW and MEDIUM severity)
- `src/gameplay/combat.gd` has 2 `# TODO` comments and 1 `# FIXME` comment
- `src/ui/hud.gd` has 0 inline debt comments

**输入：** `/tech-debt`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill reads `docs/tech-debt-register.md` — finds 2 existing items
2. Skill scans `src/` — finds 3 inline comments (2 TODOs, 1 FIXME)
3. Skill checks whether inline comments already exist in the register (deduplication)
4. Skill presents combined list sorted by severity (FIXME before TODO by default)
5. Skill asks "May I write to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"
6. User approves; register updated; verdict REGISTER UPDATED

**断言：**
- [ ] Inline comments are found by scanning `src/` recursively
- [ ] Existing register items are not duplicated
- [ ] Combined list is sorted by severity
- [ ] "May I write" prompt appears before any write
- [ ] Verdict is REGISTER UPDATED

---

### 用例 2: Register Doesn't Exist — Offered to create it

**设置：**
- `docs/tech-debt-register.md` does NOT exist
- `src/` contains 4 inline TODO/FIXME comments

**输入：** `/tech-debt`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill attempts to read `docs/tech-debt-register.md` — not found
2. Skill informs user: "No tech-debt-register.md found"
3. Skill offers to create the register with the inline items it found
4. Skill asks "May I write to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?" (create)
5. User approves; register created with 4 items; verdict REGISTER UPDATED

**断言：**
- [ ] Skill does not crash when register file is absent
- [ ] User is offered register creation (not silently skipping)
- [ ] "May I write" prompt reflects file creation (not update)
- [ ] Verdict is REGISTER UPDATED after creation

---

### 用例 3: Resolved Item Detected — Marked resolved in register

**设置：**
- `docs/tech-debt-register.md` has 3 items; one references `src/gameplay/legacy_input.gd`
- `src/gameplay/legacy_input.gd` has been deleted (refactored away)
- The referenced TODO comment no longer exists in source

**输入：** `/tech-debt`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill reads register — finds 3 items
2. Skill scans `src/` — does not find the source location referenced by item 2
3. Skill flags item 2 as RESOLVED (source is gone)
4. Skill presents the resolved item to user for confirmation
5. On approval, register is updated with item 2 marked `Status: Resolved`

**断言：**
- [ ] Skill checks whether each register item's source reference still exists
- [ ] Missing source locations result in items being flagged as RESOLVED
- [ ] User confirms before resolved items are written
- [ ] RESOLVED items are kept in the register (not deleted) for audit history

---

### 用例 4: Edge Case — CRITICAL debt item surfaces prominently

**设置：**
- `src/core/network_sync.gd` has a comment: `# FIXME(CRITICAL): race condition in sync buffer — can corrupt save data`
- `docs/tech-debt-register.md` exists with 5 lower-severity items

**输入：** `/tech-debt`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill scans source and finds the CRITICAL-tagged FIXME
2. Skill presents the CRITICAL item at the top of the output — before the full table
3. Skill asks user to acknowledge the critical item before proceeding
4. After acknowledgment, skill presents full debt table and asks to write
5. Register is updated with CRITICAL item at top; verdict REGISTER UPDATED

**断言：**
- [ ] CRITICAL items appear at the top of the output, not buried in the table
- [ ] Skill surfaces CRITICAL items before asking to write
- [ ] User acknowledgment of the CRITICAL item is requested
- [ ] CRITICAL severity is preserved in the written register entry

---

### 用例 5: Gate Compliance — No gate; register updated only with approval

**设置：**
- Inline scan finds 2 new TODOs; register has 3 existing items
- `review-mode.txt` contains `full`

**输入：** `/tech-debt`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill scans source and reads register; compiles combined debt list
2. No director gate is invoked regardless of review mode
3. Skill presents sorted debt table to user
4. Skill asks "May I write to `docs/tech-debt-register.md`?"
5. User approves; register updated; verdict REGISTER UPDATED

**断言：**
- [ ] No director gate is invoked in any review mode
- [ ] Debt table is presented before any write prompt
- [ ] "May I write" prompt appears before file update
- [ ] Write only occurs with explicit user approval

---

## 协议合规性

- [ ] Reads `docs/tech-debt-register.md` and scans `src/` before compiling
- [ ] Deduplicates inline comments against existing register items
- [ ] Sorts combined list by severity
- [ ] Always asks "May I write" before updating register
- [ ] No director gates are invoked
- [ ] Verdict is REGISTER UPDATED or NO NEW DEBT FOUND

---

## 覆盖说明

- The case where `src/` is empty or absent is not tested; behavior follows
  the NO NEW DEBT FOUND path for the inline scan, but register items would
  still be read and presented.
- TODO comments without severity tags are treated as LOW severity by default;
  this classification detail is an implementation concern, not tested here.
