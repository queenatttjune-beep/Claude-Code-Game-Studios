# Skill 测试 Spec: /test-setup

## Skill 摘要

`/test-setup` scaffolds the test framework for the project based on the
configured engine. It creates the `tests/` directory structure defined in
`coding-standards.md` (unit/, integration/, performance/, playtest/) and
generates the appropriate test runner configuration for the detected engine:
GdUnit4 config for Godot, Unity Test Runner asmdef for Unity, or Unreal headless
runner for Unreal Engine.

Each file or directory created is gated behind a "May I write" ask. If the test
framework already exists, the skill verifies the configuration rather than
reinitializing. No director gates apply. The verdict is COMPLETE when the
scaffold is in place.

## 静态断言（结构性）

Verified automatically by `/skill-test static` — no fixture needed.

- [ ] Has required frontmatter fields: `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`
- [ ] Has ≥2 phase headings
- [ ] Contains verdict keyword: COMPLETE
- [ ] Contains "May I write" collaborative protocol language before creating files
- [ ] Has a next-step handoff (e.g., `/test-helpers` to generate helper utilities)

---

## Director Gate 检查

无。 `/test-setup` is a scaffolding utility. No director gates apply.

## 测试用例

### 用例 1: Happy Path — Godot project, scaffolds GdUnit4 test structure

**设置：**
- `technical-preferences.md` has engine set to Godot 4, language GDScript
- `tests/` directory does not exist yet

**输入：** `/test-setup`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill reads engine from `technical-preferences.md` → Godot 4 + GDScript
2. Skill drafts the test directory structure: tests/unit/, tests/integration/,
   tests/performance/, tests/playtest/, and a GdUnit4 runner config file
3. Skill asks "May I write the tests/ directory structure?"
4. Directories and GdUnit4 runner script created on approval
5. Skill confirms the runner script matches the CI command in coding-standards.md:
   `godot --headless --script tests/gdunit4_runner.gd`
6. Verdict is COMPLETE

**断言：**
- [ ] All 4 subdirectories (unit/, integration/, performance/, playtest/) are created
- [ ] GdUnit4 runner config is generated
- [ ] Runner script path matches coding-standards.md CI command
- [ ] "May I write" is asked before creating any files
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

### 用例 2: Unity Project — Scaffolds Unity Test Runner with asmdef

**设置：**
- `technical-preferences.md` has engine set to Unity, language C#
- `tests/` directory does not exist

**输入：** `/test-setup`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill reads engine → Unity + C#
2. Skill creates `Tests/` directory with Unity conventions (capitalized)
3. Skill generates `Tests/Tests.asmdef` and `Tests/Editor/EditorTests.asmdef`
4. EditMode and PlayMode test runner modes are configured
5. Skill asks "May I write the Tests/ directory structure?"
6. Verdict is COMPLETE

**断言：**
- [ ] Unity-specific `Tests/` structure is created (not the Godot structure)
- [ ] `.asmdef` files are generated
- [ ] EditMode and PlayMode runner config is present
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE

---

### 用例 3: Test Framework Already Exists — Verifies config, not re-initialized

**设置：**
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` exist
- GdUnit4 runner script exists (Godot project)

**输入：** `/test-setup`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill detects existing tests/ structure
2. Skill reports: "Test framework already exists — verifying configuration"
3. Skill checks: runner script path, directory completeness, CI command alignment
4. If all checks pass: reports "Configuration verified — no changes needed"
5. If checks fail (e.g., missing tests/performance/): reports specific gap and
   asks "May I add the missing directories?"

**断言：**
- [ ] Skill does NOT reinitialize when framework exists
- [ ] Verification checks are performed on existing structure
- [ ] Only missing parts trigger a "May I write" ask
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE whether everything was OK or gaps were fixed

---

### 用例 4: No Engine Configured — Redirects to /setup-engine

**设置：**
- `technical-preferences.md` contains only placeholders (engine not set)

**输入：** `/test-setup`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill reads `technical-preferences.md` and finds engine placeholder
2. Skill reports: "Engine not configured — cannot scaffold engine-specific test framework"
3. Skill suggests running `/setup-engine` first
4. No directories or files are created

**断言：**
- [ ] Error message explicitly states engine is not configured
- [ ] `/setup-engine` is suggested as the next step
- [ ] No write tool is called
- [ ] Verdict is not COMPLETE (blocked state)

---

### 用例 5: Director Gate Check — No gate; test-setup is a scaffolding utility

**设置：**
- Engine configured, tests/ does not exist

**输入：** `/test-setup`

**预期行为：**
1. Skill scaffolds and writes all test framework files
2. No director agents are spawned
3. No gate IDs appear in output

**断言：**
- [ ] No director gate is invoked
- [ ] No gate skip messages appear
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE without any gate check

---

## 协议合规性

- [ ] Reads engine from `technical-preferences.md` before generating any scaffold
- [ ] Generates engine-appropriate test runner config (not generic)
- [ ] Creates all 4 subdirectories from coding-standards.md
- [ ] Asks "May I write" before creating files
- [ ] Detects existing framework and offers verification (not reinitialization)
- [ ] Verdict is COMPLETE when scaffold is in place

---

## 覆盖说明

- Unreal Engine test scaffolding (headless runner with `-nullrhi`) follows the
  same pattern as Cases 1 and 2 and is not separately fixture-tested.
- CI integration file generation (e.g., `.github/workflows/test.yml`) is
  referenced but not assertion-tested here — it may be a separate skill concern.
- The case where tests/ exists but is from a different engine (e.g., Unity tests
  in a now-Godot project) is not tested; the skill would detect the mismatch
  and offer to reconcile.
